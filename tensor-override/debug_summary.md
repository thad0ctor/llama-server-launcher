# Tensor Override Analysis System Debug Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **CUDA3 Completely Unused** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The GPU assignment algorithm was too conservative and didn't distribute tensors evenly across devices.
**Solution**: Improved `_find_best_gpu_device()` to prioritize load balancing over tight packing by considering utilization percentages.

### 2. **Low Overall GPU Utilization (44%)** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem**: Only 44% of available GPU memory was being utilized across all devices.
**Solution**: Multiple improvements:
- Enabled aggressive GPU utilization by default
- Reduced expert tensor GPU threshold from 0.7 to 0.5
- Improved load balancing algorithm

### 3. **Excessive Context Memory Calculations** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Over 5GB per GPU was reserved for context memory, which was excessive.
**Solution**: 
- Reduced context memory calculation from 1/3 to 1/2 of layers per GPU
- Reduced processing overhead from 5% to 2%
- Reduced safety margin from 512MB to 128MB
- Result: ~2.4GB per GPU vs original 5.2GB

### 4. **Poor Load Balancing** ✅ FIXED
**Original Distribution**:
- CUDA0: 99.9% utilization
- CUDA1: 100.0% utilization  
- CUDA2: 61.1% utilization
- CUDA3: 0.0% utilization

**Improved Distribution**:
- CUDA0: 99.7% utilization
- CUDA1: 100.0% utilization
- CUDA2: 99.8% utilization
- CUDA3: 99.8% utilization

### 5. **Inefficient Tensor Parameter Generation** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Generated parameters contained redundant patterns and poor regex optimization.
**Solution**: Created `OptimizedParameterGenerator` that produces cleaner, more efficient patterns:
- Reduced from 30+ lines to 25 optimized lines
- Better regex grouping for layer numbers
- Cleaner embedding tensor patterns

### 6. **32GB Unused GPU Memory** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Over 32GB of GPU memory remained unused despite having a 262GB model.
**Solution**: Aggressive tensor placement that moves more expert tensors to GPU when utilization allows.
